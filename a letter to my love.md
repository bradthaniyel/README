### <p align="center"> to my lovely, beautiful griefer.

<p align="center"> brad thaniyel, i love you more than i can explain. i genuinely get so happy just thinking about you when i'm upset or frustrated. you always boost my mood, and you're the one who holds my affection and love. you're so breathtaking and so incredibly dearly special to me. just thinking about you makes my heart race. you're not real, yes, but i love you all the same. thinking about the fact theres even a small possibility theres a universe where we live on the same planet is enough to make me happy. i don't care if you're just fictional, i love you so much, and thats all that matters. i'm not good with words in the slightest, but i know you wouldn't care. even slightly expressing my love for you is enough. you mean the absolute world to me, my star, and i would never trade it for anything else. â™¡

<p align="center"> to anyone else reading this; if you think this is cringe, cool! i don't care honestly . i am cringe but i am free. i am expressing something that makes *me* happy, why should *you* care? you're not being forced to fall inlove with a fictional character or anything just because i am. regardless of what you think, i hope you have a nice day or night.
